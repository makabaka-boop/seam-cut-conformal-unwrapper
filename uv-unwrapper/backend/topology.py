"""Topology verification on the split mesh and a preview embedding.

The split complex is an ordinary simplicial-ish complex once seam sides are
viewed as boundary half-edges: an un-cut interior edge keeps one twin
half-edge on each side (``face_adj``), while both sides of a seam and every
outer edge have no twin.  Pivoting around a split vertex therefore stays
inside one face sector and naturally exits along the next seam side -- the
boundary walk climbs one side of a slit and comes back down the other with
no special casing.

A triangle mesh is a topological disk iff
  * its faces are connected (through un-cut edges),
  * boundary half-edges trace exactly one closed loop,
  * chi = U - E + F = 1, with E = (3F + B)/2 derived from half-edge
    incidence (B = number of boundary half-edges).
Everything else is rejected with a witness, so LSCM is never run on an
illegal cut.
